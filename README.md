# Project5

I initially wanted to create a twitter like app but there is still more I need to learn before I venture into that territory, I also ran out of time to take on something so lengthy. I do want to thank Hunter for the explanation of how to tie it together and I will def take his advice when it comes to building one out in the future.

This project uses a php/Laravel backend for a PERN crud app.
